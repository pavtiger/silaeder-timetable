# Silaeder timetable
Since the early years of my study in **Silaeder IT school**, I always didn't really fancy out timetable.
It is located in Google Spreadsheets, and though Google tools are really cool, and I use then all the time,
it just isn't the choice for a timetable.  
I have accumulated a lot of issues for these years, so recently I decided to try and parse the data from 
Google Spreadsheets and create a web page with a beautiful design and more functionality. (like sorting grades)
